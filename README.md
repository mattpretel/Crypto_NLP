# NLP using Top Crypto Terms
*Using BTC & ETH (for now...)

In this project I will use newsAPI to pull news about the two largest cryptocurrencies to date, BTC and ETH. Once I have this news data I will use NPTK to tokenize text, retrieve n-gram counts, and form word clouds. Finally I will create a named entity recognition model and with SpaCy, visualize the tags.

This project shows the basics of NPL and how it can be demonstated in a real life use case.
